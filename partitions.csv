# Name,             Type, SubType, Offset,   Size,      Flags
# Note: if you have increased the bootloader size, make sure to update the offsets to avoid overlap
# Bootloader: 0x2000 - 0x10000 (56KB with custom bootloader)
# Partition table: 0x10000 - 0x11000 (4KB)
#
# This partition table is dynamically generated by the simulator's flash_builder
# based on actual firmware sizes. The values below represent the current layout.
#
# IMPORTANT: When adding new OTA applications, the simulator will:
# 1. Generate OTA partitions with proper sizes (firmware size + 10% padding, 64KB aligned)
# 2. Write firmware binaries to OTA partition offsets (for booting)
# 3. Also write firmware to firmware storage area at 0xEF0000 (for GUI catalog)

# Factory application - always boots first and default after reboot
factory_app,        app,  factory, 0x20000,   1M,

# Storage partitions - NVS for metadata and configuration
nvs,               data, nvs,     0x120000,  32K,
bootdata,          data, nvs,     0x128000,  12K,        readonly

# Bootloader configuration storage (used by custom bootloader for settings)
# This partition stores configuration data for the bootloader system
bootloader_config, data, nvs,     0x12B000,  2M,

# OTA partitions - dynamically sized based on firmware binaries
# The simulator generates these partitions with sizes calculated from actual firmware
# Sizes shown below are examples - actual sizes vary based on firmware binaries used
ota_0,             app,  ota_0,     0x330000,  7040K,
ota_1,             app,  ota_1,     0xA20000,  4928K,

# Firmware storage area - contains firmware binaries for GUI catalog/discovery
# This is NOT a standard ESP-IDF partition - managed by our custom firmware storage system
# Located at offset 0xEF0000, after all OTA partitions
# Stores: Firmware metadata entries + raw firmware binaries for:
#   - GUI firmware selection display
#   - Firmware flashing from SD card
#   - Firmware validation and CRC checking
